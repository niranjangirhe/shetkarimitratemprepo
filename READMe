It is Cotton Leafhopper Jassids 

Damage is caused by the nymphs and adults of Amrasca insect. They which suck the plant sap and introduce salivary toxins which are capable of  damaging the tissue and impairing photosynthesis. Moderate to high temperatures and humidity ranges of  21 to 31Â°C and 55 to 85% respectively, encourages the presence and activities of this insect.  Low temperatures and strong winds inhibit their activities.
 Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Insecticide formulations based on malathion, cypermethrin (1 ml/l), sulfoxaflor, chlorpyrifos (2.5 ml/l), dimethoate, lambdacyhalothrin (1ml/l) or chlorantraniliprole + lambda-cyhalothrin (0.5ml/l ) can be applied. They may however also affect natural predators of leafhoppers and should therefore only be applied in severe cases and in a timely manner. Seed treatment with insecticides can also help to suppress leaf hopper populations on the crop for 45-50 days.
